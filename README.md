<h1> 📊 Covid-19 Exploratory Data Analysis Project – Cleaning & Insights </h1>
🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using a real-world messy dataset.
The dataset contained null values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats, so I applied extensive preprocessing & cleaning techniques before performing analysis.

I then drafted research questions and answered them using statistical analysis & visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.

🛠️ Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

✔️ Handled missing values (null imputation, removal where necessary)
✔️ Removed duplicate records
✔️ Fixed inconsistent formats (dates, strings, numerical scaling)
✔️ Applied encoding & normalization for ML-readiness

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔️ Drafted key research questions based on dataset trends
✔️ Used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization
✔️ Checked correlations, distributions, and outliers

3. Insights & Visualizations

📌 Created plots to answer research questions:

Trends over time

Category-wise comparisons

Correlation heatmaps

Predictive insights

4. Results

Clean dataset ready for further ML modeling

Visualized answers to research questions

Gained insights into patterns & anomalies
