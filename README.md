🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using a real-world messy dataset.
The dataset contained null values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats, so I applied extensive preprocessing & cleaning techniques before performing analysis.

I then drafted research questions and answered them using statistical analysis & visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.


<h3>🛠️ Steps Involved </h3>

<h4> 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning </h4>

✔️ Handled missing values (null imputation, removal where necessary)

✔️ Removed duplicate records

✔️ Fixed inconsistent formats (dates, strings, numerical scaling)

✔️ Applied encoding & normalization for ML-readiness



<h4> 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h4>

✔️ Drafted key research questions based on dataset trends

✔️ Used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization

✔️ Checked correlations, distributions, and outliers



<h4> 3. Insights & Visualizations </h4>

📌 Created plots to answer research questions:

Trends over time

Category-wise comparisons

Correlation heatmaps

Predictive insights



<h4> 4. Results </h4>

Clean dataset ready for further ML modeling

Visualized answers to research questions

Gained insights into patterns & anomalies
